These days, I've been trying to take more time to relax, reflect, and unwind as I prepare for what seems like is going to be another pretty crazy year. Practicing reflection with this blog is one way I'm hoping to keep track of my thoughts and feelings as another year passes. 

This past year was a pretty eventful one: moving to college, working, relationships, virtual learning. It's crazy to think that a year ago today, I had never even stepped foot on a college campus! Although a bit cliche, I *do* think that I've changed a lot in the past year (hopefully mostly for the better!).
