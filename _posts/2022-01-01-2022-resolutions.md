**Happy New Years!** Every year, I try to set new year's resolutions, only to forget about them shortly after (okay, usually by like, January 2nd). This year, I'm determined to keep up with them by writing them here â€“ hopefully it'll finally help to hold myself accountable.

Either way, here are **10 goals I hope to achieve in 2022:**
1. Balance time between school and fun (work hard, play hard!)
2. Spend more intentional time with friends (less *"let's study together"*s, more "let's go do *[insert fun activity]*!")
3.  Dedicate at least 15 minutes a day to practicing Chinese (å¾ˆå¥½!)
4.  Find a productivity system and stick to it!
5. Workout regularly (do at least *something* everyday)
6. Grow da [food account](https://www.instagram.com/happyfoodadventures_/)! (take friends to get free food)
7. Do more fun data science projects (and post them on this website)
8. Remember to defrost my meat (PLEASE)
9. Read more books! (post some book reviews!)
10. And finally, do something each day to make myself happy :)

**Wish me luck! And cheers to 2022! ðŸ¥³**
