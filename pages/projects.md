#### **[Computational Photography Course Projects](../projects/cs180)**
These are my projects from [**CS 180**](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa23/), a class taught by [Alexei (Alyosha) Efros](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/) and [Angjoo Kanazawa](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/). The class focuses on computing with visual data, which includes the image processing, computer vision, computational photography, and the use of convolutional neural networks.

#### **[Disney Datathon Disney Bundle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aN5voNqq-S9PLEwuyPsmxW-S3E416YM-/view)**
Fan Favorite project as an intern team at Disney Streaming among 30 full time teams. We created a cross-platform 1-day "**Stream-Hopper**", a play on the infamous Park Hopper, to increase conversion. We used collaborative filtering and lookalike modeling to create recommendation system across Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+.

#### **[UC Berkeley CalHacks 8.0 App](https://devpost.com/software/bump-uoljre)**
Created a geolocation-based social media app called “**Bump!**” to promote community among Gen Z/Millennials to show people who may be nearby to say hi, eat with, grab a coffee, or hang out. We used React Native, Node.js, MongoDB to build interactive mapping, geolocation tracking, and instant messaging functionality.
