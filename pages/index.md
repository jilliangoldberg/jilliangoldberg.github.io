<h3 align=center> Hi there! I'm <b>Jillian</b>. </h3>

<!-- Hey there! :wave: I'm **Jillian** -->
I'm a student at **UC Berkeley**, studying [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) (EECS) + [Business Administration](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) in the [M.E.T. Program](https://met.berkeley.edu/). I'm passionate about **data science and machine learning**, and using technology to solve consumer-centric problems.

<!-- After completing my double degree in EECS + Business, I aim to use what I learn as a valuable foundation for my lifelong commitment to propel:

👩🏻‍💻women in STEM and youth empowerment \\
📈the power of consumer-centric data \\
♻️social transformation and environmental progress -->
