<h3 align=center> Hi there! I'm <b>Jillian</b>. </h3>

<!-- Hey there! :wave: I'm **Jillian** -->
I'm a student at **UC Berkeley**, studying [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) (EECS) + [Business Administration](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) in the [M.E.T. Program](https://met.berkeley.edu/). This past summer, I was an [**AI & Data Science Intern**](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/applied-ai-and-ml) at **J.P. Morgan Chase**, where I worked on an macroeconomic modeling team to build a LLM-powered summarization model and enhance the complexity of a predictive international GDP model, and previously worked at **Disney Streaming** as a **Data Science** intern. 
<!-- 
Previously, I was a **Data Science Intern** at **Disney Streaming** on the [Data Science Ad Sales](https://press.disneyadvertising.com/fact-sheet-disney-select-drives-massive-marketplace-adoption-and-results-) team, working on consumer ads data for Hulu and ESPN+.  -->

I'm currently looking for **full time roles** in machine learning, data science, or software engineering. Feel free to [**contact me**](mailto:jilliangoldberg@berkeley.edu) anytime!
