# **About Me**
<h2></h2>
<!-- :wave: -->
##### :wave: **Who am I?**
 Hi! My name is **Jillian** and I'm from üìçFrisco, TX (near Dallas). I study [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) (EECS) + [Business Administration](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) in the [Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (M.E.T.)](https://met.berkeley.edu/) program at UC Berkeley. I'm passionate about **data science and machine learning**, especially using the power of data to answer real world questions, enhance personalized consumer experiences, and improve people's daily lives. 

 I'm currently looking for full time roles in machine learning, data science, or software engineering. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:jilliangoldberg@berkeley.edu) anytime!

##### :bear: **What do I do?**
As a senior at UC Berkeley, I've shifted many of my involvements into **mentorship opportunities** to help younger students, especially young women, succeed in STEM. I'm the Professional Development and Mentorship Leader for our student-run consulting club, [Voyager Consulting](voyagerconsulting.org), where I'm helping our new members get integrated into the club and learn about consulting, technology, interviewing, career prospects, and more. I'm also the Head of Internal for [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/), where I organize events for our 500+ members and run the mentorship program. On the less academic side, I'm the Co-Captain for the [Cal Women's Club Volleyball](instagram.com/calclubvolleyball) B team, where we recently won 1st Place in the Silver Bracket out of 20 teams.

Previous involvements:
- I taught [CS 61A](cs61a.org) through [Computer Science Mentors](csmentors.berkeley.edu)
- I was a reader for UC Berkeley's [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CS 188)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp22/)
- I was a mentor in the [Engineering Berkeley Mentorship Cohort](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/programs/mentor-programs/berkeley-mentorship-cohort/).
- I led DEI initiatives in the [Society of Women Engineers](https://swe.berkeley.edu).

In high school, I developed a passion for teaching when growing [Gold Tutoring](https://goldtutoring.dudaone.com/) since 2017, and gave college apps advice through [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/JillianGoldberg) and [Gold College Essays](https://bit.ly/3d88PDc).

#####  üìà **What are my goals?**

In short? To make a **real impact** on the world. \\
More specifically, I'd like to lean into my lifelong commitment to propel:

üë≠üèª women in STEM and youth empowerment \\
üë©üèª‚Äçüíª the power of consumer-centric data \\
‚ôªÔ∏è social transformation and environmental progress

In the meantime, I'm doing my best to learn as much as I can about the things I care about. :)
