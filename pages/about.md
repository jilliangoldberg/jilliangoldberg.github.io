# **About Me**
<h2></h2>
<!-- :wave: -->
##### **Who am I?**
:wave: Hi! My name is **Jillian** and I'm from 📍Frisco, TX (near Dallas). I study [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) (EECS) + [Business Administration](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) in the [Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (M.E.T.)](https://met.berkeley.edu/) program at UC Berkeley. I'm passionate about **data science and machine learning**, especially using the power of data to answer real world questions, enhance personalized consumer experiences, and improve people's daily lives.

##### **What do I do?**
On campus, I'm a project leader, account manager, and senior advisor for [Voyager Consulting](voyagerconsulting.org), and I teach UC Berkeley's [CS 61A](cs61a.org) as an Academic Intern and through [Computer Science Mentors](csmentors.berkeley.edu). I play on the [Cal Women's Club Volleyball](instagram.com/calclubvolleyball) team and I'm a mentor in the [Engineering Berkeley Mentorship Cohort](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/programs/mentor-programs/berkeley-mentorship-cohort/).

Previously, I led DEI initiatives in the [Society of Women Engineers](https://swe.berkeley.edu) and was involved in [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/). I developed a passion for teaching when growing [Gold Tutoring](https://goldtutoring.dudaone.com/) since 2017, and gave college apps advice through [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/JillianGoldberg) and [Gold College Essays](https://bit.ly/3d88PDc).

More specifically, I'd like to lean into my lifelong commitment to propel:

In the meantime, I'm doing my best to learn as much as I can about the things I care about. :)
